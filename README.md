# Name That Carol

**Name That Carol** The aim of the website is to provide users with a way to test their knowledge of Christmas Songs in a fun and engaging way that encourages them to invite their friends to see if they can beat their score.

The decision to make this website is due to the user stories found [here](userstory.md).

## Cloning

This section describes how other software developers can clone the code to edit it elsewhere

- To clone the code so you can edit it yourself please follow the below:
PLEASE NOTE THIS IS FOR WINDOWS COMMAND LINE
  - In the GitHub repository click the dropdown for '<> code'
  - Ensure you are on 'local' and have 'https' selected, then copy the URL by clicking the symbol next to the URL box
  - Once copied in the search bar on your taskbar type in 'cmd' and open 'Command Prompt' or 'Comman Line'
  - In command line type 'git clone' and paste the url next to it
  - In file explorer locate 'This PC' down the side, then 'local disk' (usually the :C drive), then 'users', then your user, then find the folder called 'photo-guides'
  - You now have access to all the code and files locally
  - If you want to edit the code, please ensure you creat a new branch in the software you are using enabling us to potentially see the edits you have done before uploading them to the original GitHub repository
  - To create a new branch that depends on the software you are using, please google how to do this for your software

If you aren't on windows please google how to get a GitHub repository stored locally on your OS

- Some of the other JS coding concepts has been used from Love Maths as well
